<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This project is part of finding a solution for my needs of having a resource manager for my writing and inpiration. Inspired by the enviroment of writers' workshops. The app uses pages,books, and libraries, as a metaphor of instances of work, projects, and community for projects. 

It uses React, Redux, Material UI, and Firebase/Firestore.
